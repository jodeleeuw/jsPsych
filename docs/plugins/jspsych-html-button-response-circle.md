# jspsych-html-button-response-circle

This plugin displays HTML content and records responses generated by button click. The trial can be ended automatically if the subject has failed to respond within a fixed length of time. The buttons are displayed in a circle, evenly-spaced, equidistant from a fixation point. A prompt can be shown just above the button circle, and can be displayed until a response is given, or for a pre-determined amount of time. Similarly, a fixation stimulus can be shown in the center of the circle. The buttons itself, the prompt, and the fixation stimulus can all be customized using HTML formatting. 

## Parameters

In addition to the [parameters available in all plugins](/overview/plugins#parameters-available-in-all-plugins), this plugin accepts the following parameters. Parameters with a default value of *undefined* must be specified. Other parameters can be left unspecified if the default value is acceptable.



Parameter | Type | Default Value | Description
----------|------|---------------|------------
 choices             | array of strings | *undefined*                                                  | Labels for the buttons. Each different string in the array will generate a different button. 
 button_html         | HTML string      | `'<button class="jspsych-btn" style="padding:10px 10px"><img src=%choice% width="100"></button>'` | A template of HTML for generating the button elements. You can override this to create customized buttons of various kinds. The string `%choice%` will be changed to the corresponding element of the `choices` array. You may also specify an array of strings, if you need different HTML to render for each button. If you do specify an array, the `choices` array and this array must have the same length. The HTML from position 0 in the `button_html` array will be used to create the button for element 0 in the `choices` array, and so on. 
 button_size         | array            | `[120, 120]`                                                 | Two element array indicating the height and width of the response buttons. Do not forget to take any padding into account in the height and width calculation. In the case of images, define the button size as the addition of padding and image size as defined in button_html. 
prompt_html | string | "" | This string can contain HTML markup. Any content here will be displayed above the button circle. The intention is that it can be used to provide a reminder about the action the subject is supposed to take. 
prompt_duration | numeric | null | How long to display the prompt in milliseconds. The visibility CSS property of the stimulus will be set to `hidden` after this time has elapsed. If this is null, then the prompt will remain visible until the trial ends. 
fixation_html | string | "" | This string can contain HTML markup. Any content here will be displayed in the center of the button circle. The intention is that it can be used to provide a reminder about the action the subject is supposed to take, or to show a fixation image. 
fixation_size | array | `[50, 50]` | Two element array indicating the height and width of the fixation division. Do not forget to take any padding into account in the height and width calculation. In the case of images, there is no need to define fixation_size. 
fixation_duration | numeric | null | How long to display the fixation division in milliseconds. The visibility CSS property of the stimulus will be set to `hidden` after this time has elapsed. If this is null, then the fixation division will remain visible until the trial ends. 
circle_diameter | numeric | 500 | The diameter of the search array circle in pixels. 
circle_offset | numeric | 22 | The circle offset determines where on the circle the buttons will be located. 
trial_duration | numeric | null | How long to wait for the subject to make a response before ending the trial in milliseconds. If the subject fails to make a response before this timer is reached, the subject's response will be recorded as null for the trial and the trial will end. If the value of this parameter is null, the trial will wait for a response indefinitely. 
response_ends_trial | boolean | true | If true, then the trial will end whenever the subject makes a response (assuming they make their response before the cutoff specified by the `trial_duration` parameter). If false, then the trial will continue until the value for `trial_duration` is reached. You can set this parameter to `false` to force the subject to view a stimulus for a fixed amount of time, even if they respond before the time is complete.

## Data Generated

In addition to the [default data collected by all plugins](/overview/plugins#data-collected-by-all-plugins), this plugin collects the following data for each trial.

Name | Type | Value
-----|------|------
rt | numeric | The response time in milliseconds for the subject to make a response. The time is measured from when the stimulus first appears on the screen until the subject's response.
button_pressed | numeric | Indicates which button the subject pressed. The first button in the `choices` array is 0, the second is 1, and so on.

## Examples

#### Displaying question until subject gives a response

```javascript
var trial = {
    type: 'html-button-response-circle',
    choices: ["A","B","C","D","E","F"],
    button_html: '<button class="jspsych-btn" style="height:100px; width:100px;">%choice%</button>',
    button_size : [100,100],
    fixation_html: "Please click the letter you prefer",
    fixation_size: [200,100]
};
```
